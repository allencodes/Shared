This script is intended for those thinking of signing up with a dynamic DNS (ddns) provider. It can help them decide which, if any, domain name is best for them. For example, it may be helpful to see what other kind of sites use the same domain name or if a particular domain is being implemented less than others.

It's a native PowerShell v3 script and will need W7 or W8 with PoSH v3 installed.
